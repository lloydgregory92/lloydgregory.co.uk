            <p class="about-text">I was born and raised in a small village in South Wales's Rhondda Valley, I attended a Welsh speaking schools and being able to speak fluent Welsh is something I'm extremly proud of. I lived in the Rhondda until leaving for university to study a degree in Software Engineering. Music is one of my biggest passions, I will generally listen to a selection from all  genres, if I had to pick a favourite track it would have to be  -</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg384whVQzc&ab_channel=NinaSimoneVEVO">Nina Simone - I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl</a> </p>
            <p class="about-text">I spend a lot of time reading autobiographies/biographies of artist's im interested in, I recently read - ''The Doors by Greil Marcus'', a book that disects the band song by song. I'm currently living in London - Nottinghill, a stones throw away from Portobello Rd. Never did I think I would be living in such a vibrant busy area, but since moving here I can honestly say I've fallen in love with the surroundings.</p>

                <h1>Metafour UK</h1>
                <p class="about-text">I began working at Metafour in November 2014, starting as a Junior Developer I quickly established myself within the company. I am now one of the main UK developers, also UK Test Coordinator & Client Champion are roles created especially for me. During my time at Metafour I have developed an automated testing suite, it's purpose is to perform regression tests on various modules of our biggest product. Since taking on the role of UK Test Coordinator I believe that the testing standard has increased, and now works more efficiently. I have also worked on implementations & customer demos helping the Sales & Marketing teams. I also contirbute to product support, dealing with day to day issues from our Clients.</p>

                <h1>Cardiff City Stadium</h1>
                <p class="about-text">I began working at Cardiff City Stadium late 2010. It began as a part-time job so I would have some sort of income . My position at the Stadium quickly grew and was promoted to a hospitality team leader after only a few shifts. Following that I was then given the opportunity to become a Hospitality supervisor, a role that required me to take charge of a team of 20-25 member of staff, handling the service of around 2,000 guests per match. Although not connected to my field of study I believe the experienced gained at the Stadium gave me a better standing when applying for different positions.</p>

                <h1>Private Applied ICT Tutor</h1>
                <p class="about-text">I began tutoring a sixth-form pupil who was studiyng Applied ICT. I covered both Exam and Course work lessons, providing documentation which I saw useful and relevant for the teaching. I spent 2 nights a week with Josh prior to his final Course Work submission and Exam sittings, Josh felt he needed a little extra help after recieving lower predicted grades than he was expecting. Following my tutorage Josh's grades improved and he passed his course, He is now studying at University.</p>

                <h1>Teacher Assistant - Volunteer</h1>
                <p class="about-text">I spent two weeks volunteering at my old Comprehensive school, helping teach IT subjects. Taking classes from form 7 up to sixth form. Covering a range of topics from basic IT to web design and Visual Basic programming.  It was such a rewarding experience, following the two weeks I began looking into doing teaching qualifications and was convinced that I wanted to become a teacher. The only thing that kept me from following it was the idea of not developing my development skills, while teaching consists of following a syllabus and a lot of repetition, there would be little time for my own Software Development.</p>

                <h1>BSc. Software Engineering</h1>
                <p class="about-text">Studying a course at Cardiff Metropolitan University was a difficult decision, as I had an idea that gaining experience in the industry would prove more useful than studying a course, however when it came to making the final decision I applied for university as I felt it would cover a lot more areas of the industry rather than going into a specific job where my development options would be a little more narrow. I graduated University with a Second Class Degree.</p>

                <h1>A Level & A/S Level Courses</h1>
                <p class="about-text">I studied 4 courses in total whilst in Sixth-form - Art, Law, Media Studies and Computer Programming. I saw it as a diverse option, however the majority of my interest was in Programming. My results were not as good as I was expecting, I left with 2 'B' grades and 2 'C' grades.</p>
